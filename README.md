# Automated Hyprland Theming

This repository contains a set of scripts and configuration files to create a dynamic, wallpaper-based desktop theme for a Hyprland environment. The system automatically extracts colors from a chosen wallpaper and applies them to Waybar, Rofi, Qt5/Qt6 applications, and Hyprland's own window decorations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Theming:** Run a single script to generate and apply a new theme.
- **Wallpaper-Based:** Colors are intelligently extracted from any wallpaper.
- **Comprehensive:** Themes Waybar, Rofi, Qt applications, and Hyprland.
- **Customizable:** All configurations are easily editable.

## Dependencies

This setup assumes you have the following software installed:

- **Hyprland:** The Wayland compositor.
- **Waybar:** The status bar.
- **Rofi:** The application launcher.
- **`qt5ct` & `qt6ct`:** For theming Qt applications.
- **ImageMagick:** For extracting colors from wallpapers (`magick` command).
- **`swww`:** For setting wallpapers.

## Manual Setup

After cloning this repository, you must perform a few manual steps to get everything working correctly.

### 1. Copy Configuration Files

The configuration files in this repository need to be placed in your `~/.config/` directory.

```bash
# From the root of this repository
cp -r hypr rofi systemd waybar ~/.config/
```

### 2. Reload the Systemd Daemon

The theme-changing script is triggered by a `systemd` user service. After copying the service file, you must tell `systemd` to scan for new files.

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
```

### 3. Set the Qt Platform Theme

For Qt applications to use your new dynamic themes, you must set an environment variable.

1.  **Open your shell's startup file.** This is usually `~/.bash_profile`, `~/.bashrc`, or `~/.zshenv` (for Zsh).
2.  **Add the following line** to the file:

    ```bash
    export QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt6ct
    ```
    *(Note: `qt6ct` can also manage Qt5 applications, so you typically only need to set this one variable).*

3.  **Log out and log back in** for the change to take effect.

### 4. Select a Theme in `qt5ct`/`qt6ct`

After running the theme script for the first time, you will need to open `qt5ct` and `qt6ct` and select "GeneratedTheme" from the list of color schemes.

Once these steps are complete, you can click the magic wand icon (ðŸª„) on Waybar to change your theme at any time.
